## Hi, I’m Denis. 👋
I am a software engineer with experience in software development and testing in several programming languages. 👨‍💻

In my own way, I am an adaptable, self-motivated and hardworking person who likes to pay attention to details. Some of the skills I try to invest in are problem solving, design and mental skills, because I think any software developer should have them. ⭐

I am also constantly trying to develop my communication skills so that I can maintain a good long-term understanding with the people around me. ✅

## Work experience. ⚒️
Software developing with C++ & Qt framework, in writing the code, I used some principles of object oriented programming and design patterns. 📝

Unit testing with C++, I made use of GoogleMock, EasyMock and Qt framework. 🧪

Integration testing, I defined some test scenarios for the new functionalities, I created test cycles after the scenarios defined and added them in the regressions to test the integrity of software modules. 🧩
